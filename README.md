# Iron Giant
###Side-scrolling PC video game based around the popular children's character, built in Unreal Engine 4

This project is for the senior year Capstone project in Spring 2016, with all development done by [Chun Zheng](https://github.com/ZhengC1) and [James Corsi](https://github.com/WamboJambo).  The base project will consist of several features, including scaling level design and difficulty, saved state progress, a potential corresponding mobile app, and possibly even more features, all of which are contingent upon time constraints as the semester progresses.
