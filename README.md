# Iron Giant
###Side-scrolling PC video game based around the popular children's character, built in UnrealEngine 4

This project is for the senior year Capstone project in Spring 2016, with all development done by [Chun Zheng](https://github.com/ZhengC1) and [James Corsi](https://github.com/WamboJambo).  The base project will consist of several features, including scaling level design and difficulty, saved state progress, a potential corresponding mobile app, and possibly even more features, all of which are contingent upon time constraints as the semester progresses.

TODO:

- ~~Develop a working prototype~~
- Draw and insert new main character sprite
  - Idle sprite (only needs a full atlas if we want, say, a moving idle sprite - think fighting games)
  - Running animation sprite (has to be atlas to animate movement and make it fluid - preferably ten frames or more)
- ~~Change platform textures~~
- Implement damage and enemies
- Insert music soundtrack/sound effects
